============

trayhost is an open source project. If you want to contribute to make it better, that's much appreciated!

trayhost is primarily implemented and tested on macOS at this time. It's structured to allow Linux and Windows backends to exist, but those are not complete and can use work - feel free to take ownership there.

For macOS backend, bug fixes or obvious improvements are welcome as Pull Requests.

If you see a missing feature or want to suggest an API change (improvement), I'm glad to hear it and consider them, but please open an issue to discuss it first.
